Scripts starting with 'get_' are for computing masses and fractions from the Simba snapshots.
Scripts starting with 'plot_' are for computing stats (medians etc.) and producing plots.

1) get_mass_budget:
Computes the total masses and metal masses of the specified phases, as well as fractions wrt the total available baryon
mass and wrt the cosmic fraction of baryons.

2) plotting_methods:
Binning, get stats for different phases, get cosmic variance errors, reading and writing data to file.

3) plot_mass_budget:
Masses of different phases as a function of stellar mass, separated into star forming and quenched.

4) plot_mass_frac_available:
Mass fractions of different phases as a function of stellar mass, separated into star forming and quenched.

5) plot_mass_frac_omega:
Mass fractions of different phases wrt cosmic baryon fractions, as a function of stellar mass, separated into star forming and quenched.

6) plot_metal_budget:
Metal masses of different phases as a function of stellar mass, separated into star forming and quenched.

7) plot_metal_frac_available:
Metal mass fractions of different phases as a function of stellar mass, separated into star forming and quenched.

8) plot_metallicities:
Metallicities of different phases as a function of stellar mass, separated into star forming and quenched.
