Scripts starting with 'get_' are for computing masses and fractions from the Simba snapshots.
Scripts starting with 'plot_' are for computing stats (medians etc.) and producing plots.
Scripts ending in '_winds.py' compare the different wind models.

- get_mass_budget:
Computes the total masses and metal masses of the specified phases, as well as fractions wrt the total available baryon
mass and wrt the cosmic fraction of baryons.

- plotting_methods:
Binning, get stats for different phases, get cosmic variance errors, reading and writing data to file.

- plot_mass_actual:
Masses of different phases as a function of stellar mass, separated into star forming and quenched.

- plot_mass_frac_available:
Mass fractions of different phases as a function of stellar mass, separated into star forming and quenched.

- plot_mass_budget_available:
Makes joint figure of mass budgets and available fractions.

- plot_mass_frac_omega:
Mass fractions of different phases wrt cosmic baryon fractions, as a function of stellar mass, separated into star forming and quenched.

- plot_mass_budget_omega:
Makes joint figure of mass budgets and fractions wrt omega.

- plot_metal_actual:
Metal masses of different phases as a function of stellar mass, separated into star forming and quenched.

- plot_metal_frac_available:
Metal mass fractions of different phases as a function of stellar mass, separated into star forming and quenched.

- plot_metal_budget:
Makes joint figure metal budget and available metal fractions.

- plot_metallicities:
Metallicities of different phases as a function of stellar mass, separated into star forming and quenched.

- plot_gas_metallicities_winds:
Makes plot of metallicities of specific gas phases across wind models.

- plot_gas_metallicities_difference:
As above but plots the difference between Simba and each wind model.
