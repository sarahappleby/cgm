# cgm
Working repository for studying the CGM in the Simba simulations.
This repository contains the code for several CGM projects:
- Mass and metal budgets of the CGM and metallicities of halo components across a range of galaxy stellar masses, comparing the Simba
simulations with and without different modes of black hole feedback.
- Comparison of CGM in absorption to the COS-Halos and COS-Dwarfs surveys, and comparing with and without black hole feedback
- Examining the physical conditions of CGM absorbers
- Predicting physical conditions from absorption observables using random forests

For examining CGM budgets, see the `budgets` directory. For anything relating to CGM absorbers, see the `absorption` drirectory.
