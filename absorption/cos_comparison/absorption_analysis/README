Scripts beginning 'get_' compute absorption statistics and save these to file.
Scripts beginning 'plot_' produce plots.

Scripts ending '_winds' compare the wind models.
scripts ending '_background' compare the ionising background models.
Scripts with '_difference' plot the difference between wind/background models.
Scripts ending '_resolution' compare simulation boxes with different volumes and resolutions.

- equivalent_width.py
Shockingly, computes the equivalent width and saves to file. Run this first.

- get_rho_ew_med.py
Computes the median EW in bins, either of physical kpc or rho/r200.

- get_rho_cfrac.py
As above for covering fraction.

- get_rho_path_absorption.py
As above for total path absorption, dEW/dz

- get_rho_path_absorption_thresh.py
As above for total path absorption above the detection threshold.

- physics.py
Contains methods for the physical quantities.

- analysis_methods.py
Binning, uncertainties, etc.

- cosmic_variance.py
Computes cosmic variance uncertainties.

- plot_cos_data.py
Plotting methods for the raw COS-Dwarfs and COS-Halos data.
