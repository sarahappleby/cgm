This directory contains scripts for analysing the absorber sample in the 'Physical conditions in the CGM' paper

- Scripts with 'equivalent_width' compute the total equivalent width for each LOS (directly from the spectra).
- Scripts with 'gather_' group the fitted absorption information from each spectrum file into one file containing
all absorber information. 
- Scripts with 'get_' are used to compute results/ save information.
- Scripts with 'plot_' are used for plotting.

- Scripts used in Appleby+22 are also set aside in the 'appleby_2022' directory for clarity :)
