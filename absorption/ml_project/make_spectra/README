This directory contains scripts for generating the spectra and absorber sample for the 'Physical Conditions in the CGM' paper and resulting 
machine learning project. We divide Mstar-sSFR space into 18 sections and select 12 Simba galaxies from each section, then generate synthetic 
spectra in their CGM at a range of impact parameters and angles for HI and selected metals: MgII, CII, SiIII, CIV, OVI.

Step 1) get_galaxy_sample.py - selects the underlying galaxy sample randomly from the regions in phase space and saves out the galaxy ids and 
properties.

Step 2) plot_galaxy_sample.py - generates plots of the galaxy sample.

Step 3) select_los_particles.py - identifies a particle list for each galaxy in the sample, of gas particles whose smoothing lengths intersect
with the line of sight. Each galaxy has 40 lines of sight (8 angles and 5 impact parameters).

Step 4) save_new_dataset.py - using the list of LOS gas particles, save out a new snapfile from the original Simba snapfile containing only the
LOS particles.

Step 5) pipeline.py - the main pipeline for generating the spectra for each line of sight. Uses the methods in generate_spectra.py

Step 6) fit_profiles.py - do the actual fitting, one spectrum file at a time. Checks whether the file already has a fit saved and if not, uses 
spectrum.py to call the pygad voigt profile fitting.

Submission files live in the 'submission' directory.

Scripts with 'satellites' are used to perform the same tasks but for the satellite-only test. Similarly 'no_uvb' scripts are for the test without
the UV photoionising background.

Miscellaneous scripts live in the 'tasks' directory.
